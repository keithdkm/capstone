# capstone
This is my solution to the capstone project of the Coursera Data Science Specialization and it brings together
the various subjects studied in the course - R Programming, data cleaning, data exploration, statistical inference,
predictive model building and data product building

The aim of the project was to take build a predictive typing model that would suggest the next 
word to a user as they type. A statistical analysis of several large sets of publically available text data: 
blog posts; news articles; and Twitter posts,  was performed by counting the frequency of 1,2,3 and 4 word ngrams.
These frequencies were then used to build a model of the likelihoods of a particular given the three prior words. 
To show the model in operation,a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com "Shiny R Studio")-based 
text editor was built that allows the user to type text and that generates a suggested next word every time the user
completes a word.
